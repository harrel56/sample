For each project the whole source-project folder and folder with compiled binaries have been provided. All programs have been compiled  (32 bit) with MS Visual Studio 2015.

1.Matrices - addition, subtraction, multiplication of matrices. The command line interface is provided. Moreover, a documentation has been generated by 'DoxyGen' tool and can be accessed in /Matrices/Doc/index.html.

2.MoveFile - moving file from one location to another. It has been designed for command line execution. This program takes 2 arguments - a source file and a directory. It returns 0 on success and 1 otherwise. No files will be overwiritten without user permission.

3.MyPlanner - GUI application developed in QT framework. It uses SQLite database. The compiled program has a lot of dependencies (dynamic linking) and I tried to provide all of the .dll files but it can turn out that something is still missing.
